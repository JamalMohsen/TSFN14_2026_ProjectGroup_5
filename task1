1. Current Application Architecture
1.1 Overview

MMJAuto is a web-based application that allows users to browse car models and car parts, manage a wishlist, and receive notifications.
The system also supports administrator functionality for managing car models and car parts.

The application is built using a client–server architecture with a clear separation between frontend, backend, and database.

The system is structured to support basic e-commerce-style functionality and user management, including:

Authentication

Role-based access

Notifications

1.2 Main Components

The application consists of the following main components:

Frontend (React)

The frontend is built using React and Material UI (MUI).
It provides the user interface for both customers and administrators.

The frontend is responsible for:

Displaying car models and car parts

Handling user login and registration

Providing search functionality for car models and car parts

Managing user interactions such as wishlists

Communication with the backend is done using HTTP/REST requests via Axios.

Backend (Node.js & Express)

The backend is implemented using Node.js and Express.
It exposes a REST API that handles application logic and data processing.

The backend is responsible for:

Authentication and authorization (JWT-based)

Business logic and validation

Handling CRUD operations for car models and car parts

Managing notifications and wishlist functionality

Database (MongoDB Atlas)

The application uses MongoDB Atlas as its database solution.
Data access is handled through Mongoose, which provides schemas and models for structured data handling.

Stored data includes:

Users and roles

Car models

Car parts

Wishlist items

External Services

The system integrates an email service used for notifications, such as:

New car parts added

Restocked car parts

1.3 Component Communication

Users interact with the system through a web browser

The React frontend communicates with the backend using REST API calls

The Express backend processes requests and interacts with MongoDB Atlas

The backend triggers the email service when notification events occur

1.4 Architectural Style

The application follows:

Client–Server Architecture

REST-based API design

Layered architecture, consisting of:

Presentation layer (React)

Application layer (Express)

Data layer (MongoDB)

1.5 Key Technologies and Libraries

React

Material UI (MUI)

Node.js

Express

MongoDB Atlas

Mongoose

Axios

JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

2. Scalability and Fault-Tolerance Issues

This section highlights potential scalability and fault-tolerance issues relevant to the application.

2.1 Resource Usage

As the number of users increases:

CPU and memory usage on the backend may grow

Database queries may become more expensive

Search functionality for car models and car parts could increase load on the database

2.2 Shared State

The application relies on:

A single MongoDB database shared by all users

This shared resource could become a bottleneck under high traffic.

2.3 Concurrency Handling

The backend processes multiple requests concurrently

Potential risks include:

Race conditions when updating stock values

Multiple administrators modifying the same data simultaneously

2.4 Blocking Operations

Long-running database queries could slow down request handling

Email notifications are triggered synchronously, which may delay responses

2.5 External Dependencies

The application depends on external services such as:

MongoDB Atlas

Email service

Failures in these services can affect system availability.

3. Fault Tolerance Considerations
3.1 Single Points of Failure

The system has several single points of failure:

One backend service

One database

Centralized configuration and secrets

3.2 Error Handling

Errors are handled using middleware in the backend

Some errors may still result in unclear responses to users

3.3 Dependency Failures

Database downtime prevents data access

Email service failures stop notification delivery

3.4 Restart and Recovery

The backend can be restarted manually (e.g. using nodemon)

Application state is persisted in the database

3.5 Observability

Errors are logged to the backend console

No advanced monitoring or logging solution is implemented

Conclusion

The MMJAuto application has a clear and structured architecture suitable for a small to medium-sized system.
However, several scalability and fault-tolerance challenges exist, particularly regarding shared resources, external dependencies, and single points of failure.
